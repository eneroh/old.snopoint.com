					<p>29 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reversal of xhtml format and return back to normal HTML5. After recent discovery of xhtml being built from html4, so yikes there. Hoping to retain .html format removal from url</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>26 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Minor proof-reading changes</li>
					<li>Increase of font-size for main navbar, formerly 85% now 100%</li>
					<li>Cool designs for projects page, may be reflected for other pages as well: <a class="emphasis" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eneroh/Eneroh.github.io/master/images/design01.png">design 1</a> & <a class="emphasis" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eneroh/Eneroh.github.io/master/images/design02.png">design 2</a></li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>24 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Projects page overhaul</li>
					<li>Actual images to replace image placeholders, resize to fit on page. Pixel based to retain shape on smartphone as well. Looks solid</li>
					<li>Proofreading my own code hurts me physically</li>
					<li>h2 and h3 elements added to make text more visible</li>
					<li>alt text added to images on projects page for accessibility purposes, have to appeal to sight impaired as well as, connectivity impaired persons :o <i>*cough*</i> also improves site compliance</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>23 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Changes to services, adding emphasis a class and hrefs to domain name and relevant sub-domains</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>16 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Return back to Cloudflare DNS, site is accessible again and no longer linked to my personal web server</li>
					<li>Official removal of contact.html page from github, form has been deleted entirely. Which kind of sucks because that sure was one neat form ):</li>
					<li>Changes made to every page in relation to changes made yesterday. Nav, page links, footer addition and formatting, formatting in general for each page</li>
					<li>Bit of a serious overhaul, now that removal of form has been accomplished. I do not require extended features, I am satisfied with github pages once more.
					Therefore the website will stay here until I feel like moving the web server to say a... VPS. A solution like a VPS almost guarantees no downtime, unlike my server aha</li>
					<li>Satisfied with change as of right now. Just need to change the 3 images at the end of index.html as they are not symmetrical, qucik fix but tad lazy right now and perhaps the main nav.
					It doesn't appear symmetrical either and kind of annoys the OCD in me. Images for proejcts page placemakers and perhaps a more organised feel</li>
					<li>Drop downs for nav that auto go to specific sections of pages</li>
					<li>Path displays like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_breadcrumbs.asp">breadcrumb navigation</a></li>
					<li>+ other cosmetic items that make the website less boring. I really want to explore a forum like solution. Time will tell if I ever get around to that though. Personally thinking a discourse website
					or perhaps I'll make it myself similar to this website. Who knows?</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>15 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Big navbar changes, normal not mobile. Specifically, changes of padding-top from percentage based 1-2% to 22.5px or pixel based formatting.</li>
					<li>Temporarily re-up of nginx web server to do serious and speedy website updates</li>
					<li>Cloudflare pointing to my external temporarily, index.html doesn't even load due to lacking of ssl cert. Cloudflare ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
					<li>Changes made to contact.html and contactform.php: i.e. a lot of php code has been repeatedly changed, nginx back-end annoying the hell outta me with the config file.</li>
					<li>So apparently I need an email server in the background of my website for form functionality to work correctly</li>
					<li>Scrapping of form for mailto:<myself> using an icon at footer. Simplifies everything and security is maintained as having two services (email and web) on the same server is a security nightmare.
					Also because I don't wanna get spammed due to having to lessen spamassassin rules for the mail server to function</li>
					<li>Prior to the great form scrapping of 2022, I was looking at alternatives ranging from javascript mailing methods, as well as phpmailer. Sadly, I am incredibly disappointed. The js method works well but requires me to 
					input my gmail smtp password in plaintext, or to secure/obsure my password I need to look into frameworks like node.js. Yeah, nope</li>
					<li>Finally fixed coloring issues of main navbar and mobile nav bar, footer as well as all a/hyperlink related links. They now have a snazzy timer and hover based color (#007eff) transition. 
					Special thanks to <a href="http://csszengarden.com">http://csszengarden</a> for the inspiration</li>
					<li>Footer added at the bottom of the contact webpage, soon to be all. A lot of formatting around the a/hyperlink class "icon"</li>
					<li>@media changes for previous 1136px to now 1414px as changes have been made to navhead image</li>
					<li>navhead has had resizing issues and to combat this I have reformatted navhead image and the padding element around it. Now no more nav blocking is occuring, woohoo</li>
					<li>Main nav has outdated and rather limited fontawesome icons, replaced 4.7.0 version to latest 6.0.0.beta3, looking more recent and footer has icons that were inaccessible previously</li>
					<li>Contact page is soon to be deleted entirely as with new footer introuction, a contact page or contact form will no longer be necessary</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>13 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Big, stressful move from Namecheap DNS to Cloudflare</li>
					<li>Stressful DNS move to Cloudflare successful, had a bit of stress with my email server but its resolved now</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>12 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Significant changes made to navbar and @media</li>
					<li>Addition of @media max-width 1136px and changes made to 992px values</li>
					<li>Pixel based nav .right element changed from 1% to 15px a fixed size that looks much better all round</li>
					<li>Removal of nav .left padding and nav .navhead class during resize/@media change at 1136px</li>
					<li>Big nav changes specifically nav background and color change are consistent all round and actually present correctly</li>
					<li>New button hover style in place, instead of text appearing #007eff, dominant blue color of website and background being white/blue. The background is bone color #f4f4f4. Deed is done, looks neat</li>
					<li>Change made to mobile navbar as well but were reversed because the nav bar was perfect. *Note to self* never change .active and .current. Wayyyy too much of a hassle</li>
					<li>Trying to pick an appropriate full stack to proceed with further development. Thinking a lot of the MEAN stack but I am more familiar with LEMP. Decisions, decisions. Probs gonna be LEMP. More to come</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>6 Jan 2022</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Changes made to infohead and info body tags on styles.css, resize revealed weird massive head and body elements. Changed from
					percentages 1.75% and 1.75% for padding to pixels 15px and 20px respectively. Looking much cleaner</li>
					<li>With the completion of the email server, the contact page and essentially all other elements of Snopoint are essentially completed</li>
					<li>Moved from original domain snopoint.xyz to snopoint.com, due to mail service disliking .xyz TLD. Lots of scammers use it apparently, 
					understandable due to how much cheaper .xyz tlds are. Trust factor is also much better when using a .com TLD so there's that</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>31 Dec 2021</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Creation of form for contact page</li>
					<li>Form based on template on w3schools</li>
					<li>actionform.php addition to website docs</li>
					<li>Changed name of actionform.php to contactform.php</li>
					<li>Formatting changes for the form to make it look more appealing and match website theme</li>
					<li>Specific label changes including color and addition of different labels</li>
					<li>Form based on template on w3schools</li>
					<li>Options for Country dropdown added (Top 10 countries added)</li>
					<li>Send action functionality appears broken</li>
					<li>Investigation proves Github functionality doesn't support POST, which is absolutely necessary in sending forms/emails</li>
					<li>Alternatives will be the next avenue to pursue as Github doesn't possess the functionality required for this project</li>
					<li>Will need to proceed w/ self-hosting and creation of VPS based email server, as this is required to receive emails</li>
					<li>Changes made to viewport, specifically for nav, navhead image in annoying me so I've made</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>30 Dec 2021</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Conversion to xhtml successful, no longer will you see .html in the url bar following the snopoint domain</li>
					<li>Changes made to Services page to edit "Status" in servtab div and center as issues arose</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>8 September 2020</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Noticed a navbar issue with 14 inch laptop screens and with window resizing on desktop</li>
					<li>Looked into issue and decided to remove percentage based width formatting and replace with pixel based to maintain box shape during resize</li>
					<li>Also moved nav right element more to the right using percentages, may need to replace with pixels as well shortly, as box shape doesn't retain at resize</li>
					<li>Unsure if I should scrap design for desktop navbar and replace altogether with mobile navbar due to complexity. Leaning towards maintaining both for A E S T H E T I C though</li>
					<li>Resizing and other items appear to be okay now. Basically at final design phase, not really much else to do than to remove placeholders, specifically: images and put actual images down</li>
					<li>Really simple stuff, conversion to xhtml on hold for the meantime</li>
					<li>css grids style replacement doesn't appear like a valid change currently</li>
					<li>Previously mentioned table of contents will be implemented down the track as well</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
					<p>26 July 2020</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Added font awesome icons to nav bar, reflected changes to all pages</li>
					<li>Requested feedback from "stakeholders"</li>
					<li>Informed me of navhead text not being centered on Google Chrome web browser <a href="../images/navissue.png">Image</a></li>
					<li>Resolved using a transparent image made using GIMP and adding navhead div</li>
					<li>Lots of Formatting for nav</li>
					<li>Idea to add image slideshow may have to be implemented shortly</li>
					<li>Idea for adding a section shortcut textbox to each webpage, to make points of interest easier to reach</li>
					<li>Site is reaching final design phase</li>
					<li>May update design later to follow css grids layout but very doubtful</li>
					<li>The website url has the .html format after the page name, other sites do not have this. To remove the .html format, I believe you need to convert all pages to xhtml. Determining whether going down this avenue is worth following</li>
					<li>Research says that it's a simple fix, may implement shortly when I manage to free up time</li>
					<li>Consolidation of website</li>
				</ul>
