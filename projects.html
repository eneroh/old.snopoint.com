						<br>This device is my main computer used to communicate with 
						my server,
						video-edit, study, unwind etc.
						<br><br>

						clock

						Usage:<br><br>
						Portable media consumers, coding machines, also used as a

						Laptop 1:<br>
						Lenovo Thinkpad T440P
						<br><br>[images]
						<br><br>Overview
						<br>This device has been receiving high praise for its 
						upgradability, durability and capability even though it 
						is a laptop from Late 2013.
						<br>
						I purchased this laptop from ebay for $300 and decked it 
						out with necessary upgrades to make it very formidable 
						compared to recent laptops.
						<br>
						The Intel i7 4702MQ that I installed into this unit performs 
						slightly better than my Dell XPS's cpu in benchmarks 
						(see below)
						<br><br>
						<a href="../images/benchmark.png" 
						alt="benchmark of two cpus">image</a>
						<br><br>
						How does a cpu from 2014 slightly outperform a cpu from 2017?
						<br>
						This is because the i7 4702<B>MQ</B> is a mobile processor. 
						While the 8550<b>U</b> is an Ultra low power cpu. Meaning 
						some "cpu power" is sacrificed to improve the laptop's 
						battery life. If you compare tdps of the CPUs this makes 
						this point clear.
						<br><br>
						I also achieve 4 hours of battery life on my T440P compared 
						to my Dell XPS's 12+ hours
						<br><br>
						Original Specs:
						<br>CPU: Intel i5 4300M, 2 cores 4 threads, 2.6ghz base, 
						37W tdp

						<br>Screen: 14" HD 1366x768 TN panel
						<br>Keyboard: Non-backlit chicklet keyboard
						<br>Touchpad: Default flat touchpad
						<br>Battery: 6-cell
						<br>Charger: Incorrect charger

						<br><br>
						Laptop 2:<br>
						Dell XPS 13 9360
						<br><br>
						[images]
						<br><br>
						<br>I've always wanted a Dell XPS 13 9360 as they have 
						renowned Linux support and this device looks great. 
						I also needed a laptop with better battery 
						life, as mentioned previously.
						<br><br>
						Specifications:
						<br>CPU: Intel I7 8550U 4 cores, 8 threads 1.8GHZ base 15W tdp
						<br>GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620
						<br>RAM: 8GB 2x4GB 1866mhz soldered DRR4 memory

						Router
						<br><br>
						[images]
						<br><br>
						<br>
						Usage:
						<br>
						Fairly self-explanatory. Handles network routing of traffic. 
						Where I port-forward, handle security, rarely run services, 
						monitor traffic.
						<br><br>
						Overview
						<br>
						Networking can be very tricky but once you get the hang of 
						it, it's interesting. As the router I purchased doesn't have 
						modem functionality, I still use my old modem router 
						but in bridging mode, which puts the device into a low power 
						state and acts strictly as a modem connected to my new 
						router via an ethernet cable connected to the ethernet 
						and wan ports respectively.
						<br><br>
						Netgear Nighthawk R8000 AC3200
						<br><br>
						I will not be listing this devices specs, as the specs 
						weren't the focus.
						This router was typically $300 at it's release, however 
						I managed to wrangle one for $120. 
						The main reason I had my eyes on this router was because of
						it's open source firmware support, 
						what's better is that the firmware is still
						being updated today.
							
						The original firmware Netgear Genie was replaced with 
						<a href="https://www.freshtomato.org">FreshTomato</a>.
						However the firmware is limited to certain cpu's, 
						making a strict list of supported routers.
						<br><br>
						Regardless, I am very impressed with this router so far. 
						Down the track,
						I plan to use a full system with
						<a href="https://pfsense.org">pfsense</a>. 
						But currently, I am happy with FreshTomato for home use.
						<br><br>
						Server
						<br><br>
						Usage:
						<br>Provide services to me and my server patrons
						<br><br>
						Overview:
						<br>
						My major project, this was a long time interest of mine 
						but recently I've become able to pursue this project. 
						Essentially, I've repurposed a workstation pc I had 
						bought off ebay for $380 into a Server. With the total
						price of the project reaching: ~$1.2K.
						<br><br>

						<br>CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2630V2 6 cores, 12 threads, 
						2.6GHZ base, 80w tdp

						<br>RAM: 4x4gb Hynix 1866MHZ ECC DDR3 memory
						<br>Optical Drives: 2x DVD drives
						<br>Storage: None
						<br><br>
						Current Specs:
						<br>CPU: 2x Intel Xeon E5 2630V2 6 cores, 12 threads, 
						2.6GHZ base, 80w tdp
						<br>GPU: 1x AMD ATI FirePro V3900 1GB GDDR3
						<br>RAM: 4x16GB Samsung 1866MHZ ECC DDR3 memory
						<br>Optical Drives: 2x DVD drives
						<br>Storage: Samsung 1TB 860 EVO
						<br>WD Red 1TB
						<br><br>
						Planned/Final Specs:
						<br>CPU: 2x Intel Xeon E5 2630V2 6 cores, 12 threads, 
						2.6GHZ base, 80w tdp
						<br>GPU: None
						<br>RAM: 4x16GB Samsung 1866MHZ ECC DDR3 memory
						<br>Optical Drives: 1/2x DVD Drives
						<br>Storage: 2x WD UltraStar 4TB 7200RPM Enterprise 
						Drives in Raid 1
						<br><br>
						Smartphone
						<br><br>
						[images]
						<br><br>
						Usage:
						<br>Make calls, send texts, device to test projects, 
						use apps etc.
						<br><br>
						Overview:
						<br>
						A slight side project, after being an android user for many 
						years. I decided to branch out and look into alternatives. 
						Open source alternatives to be exact. LineageOS. 
						A fork of CyanogenMod, which was a fork of android.
						LineageOS is a much more capable OS with support for a 
						wide range of devices and added security measures 
						missing within Google's Android. 
						The custom rom flashing process wasn't too complicated and
						made the hands-on experience more enjoyable.

						<br><br>
						Sony Xperia Z3 Compact
						<br><br>
						This is my current device, 
						please view the link if you are interested in the specs. 
						I focused on comfortability, 
						portability (not a fan of phablets) and power 
						and decided to purchase this device on ebay and yes, 
						the device is still receiving LineageOS updates.
						<br><br>
						Apps I recommend:
						<br>Fdroid (application repository)
						<br>Signal or Briar (secure communications apps)
						<br>Jquarks (Web Browser)
						<br>Simple applications suite (group of applications)
						<br>Open Street Maps or osmand live (gps)
						<br>NewPipe (Open source Youtube Viewer)
